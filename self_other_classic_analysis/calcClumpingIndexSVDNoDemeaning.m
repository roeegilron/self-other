% Option 2 (backup):
% Here is a new measure of multivariate symmetry, in the spirit of [1] and [2], (with some [3]):
% The idea is based on the observation that the Wilcoxon signed rank statistic is sensitive to the break of the symetry of a distribution [3].
% I thus adapt (i.e. simplify) a multivatiate version of the Wilcoxon signed rank. I allow myself to simplify, since we are not interested in inference, but only in the break of symmetry.
% The workflow:
% (1) First center the data so that we know we are not detecting effects, but merely symmetry breaks.
% (2) Compute the proposed multivariate Wilcoxon in each sphere.
% (3) Create maps of the generalized Wilcoxon and hope that the RFX only regions are less symmetric than FFX.
%
% Computing the measure:
% (1) Compute the pairwise sum of all two voxels (returning (27 choose 2) vectors of dim 27).
% (2) Divide each such vector by its norm. (returning (27 choose 2) vectors of dim 27)
% (3) Take the average of the normalize vectors. (returning 1 vector of dim 27)
% (4) Take the norm of the average. (returning a number).
%
% The larger the asymmetry, the larger this number.
